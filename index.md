A Framework for Writing Your Manifesto
A great manifesto is clear, bold, and unapologetically you. Here is a process to help you craft it.

Step 1: Brainstorm Your Core Beliefs
Forget about structure for a moment. Open a blank page and write freely, answering these questions. Don't censor yourself.

Beliefs & Values:

What are 3-5 principles you believe in, unconditionally? (e.g., "I believe in radical honesty," "I believe creativity is a basic human need.")

What do you know to be true, even if you can't prove it?

What standards do you hold yourself to, no matter what?

Action & Opposition:

What injustice in the world makes you angry or moves you to act?

What common belief do you reject? What will you not tolerate from yourself or others?

What does the world need more of? What does it need less of?

Vision & Purpose:

If you could build a better world, what would it look like?

What is your unique purpose or contribution? What are you here to do?

What change do you want to create, even on a small scale?

Step 2: Choose a Structure and Tone
Once you have a cloud of ideas, you can give them a structure. Most manifestos follow a simple pattern:

The Opening Declaration: Start with a powerful "I believe," "We assert," or a statement of purpose.

Example: "This is a declaration of a life lived with intention."

Example: "We reject the status quo of mindless consumption."

The Body - Your Core Tenets: List your principles. Use a numbered list, bullet points, or a series of strong paragraphs. Repetition can be very effective here.

Example (using "We will..."):

1. We will choose curiosity over comfort.

2. We will create more than we consume.

3. We will treat attention as our most valuable resource.

The Closing - A Call to Action or Vision: End with a look toward the future or a final, powerful commitment.

Example: "Join us, or get out of the way."

Example: "This is my commitment. This is the work of my life."

Your tone should be authentic to you. Are you analytical, passionate, defiant, poetic, minimalist? Use language that feels natural.

Step 3: Write and Refine
Write the first draft quickly. Get the ideas down without worrying about perfection.

Use strong, active verbs. Instead of "I think we should be honest," write "We will be honest" or "We practice honesty."

Read it aloud. This is the best way to catch awkward phrasing and feel the rhythm of your words. Does it sound powerful? Does it sound like you?

Let it rest. Step away for a day, then come back and edit with fresh eyes. Trim anything that isn't essential.
